About the data set
Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.

The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns.

The target field, called "custcat", has four possible service categories that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows:

Basic Service
E-Service
Plus Service
Total Service
Our objective is to build a classifier to predict the service category for unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K-nearest neighbors.

"""
Hence, we can say that we have records of 281 customers who opt for Plus Services, 266 for Basic-services, 236 for Total Services, and 217 for E-Services. 
It can thus be seen that the data set is mostly balanced between the different classes and requires no special means of accounting for class bias.

We can also visualize the correlation map of the data set to determine how the different features are related to each other.

As is visible from the correlation map, some features have beeter correlation among them than others, basically indicating the depth of relationship between the two features.
What is of interest to us is the correlation of the target feature, i.e. custcat with all the other features.

Normalize Data
Data normalization is important for the KNN model.

KNN makes predictions based on the distance between data points (samples), i.e. for a given test point, the algorithm finds the k-nearest neighbors by measuring the distance between 
the test point and other data points in the dataset. By normalizing / standardizing the data, you ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculation.
Since normalization scales each feature to have zero mean and unit variance, it puts all features on the same scale (with no feature dominating due to its larger range).

This helps KNN make better decisions based on the actual relationships between features, not just on the magnitude of their values.
"""

"""
Train Test Split
Now, you should separate the training and the testing data. You can retain 20% of the data for testing purposes and use the rest for training. 
Assigning a random state ensures reproducibility of the results across multiple executions.

KNN Classification¶

Initially, you may start by using a small value as the value of k, say k = 4.

Accuracy evaluation
In multilabel classification, accuracy classification score is a function that computes subset accuracy. 
This function is equal to the jaccard_score function. Essentially, it calculates how closely the actual labels and predicted labels are matched in the test set.

"""
Choosing the correct value of k
K in KNN, is the number of nearest neighbors to examine. However, the choice of the value of 'k' clearly affects the model.
Therefore, the appropriate choice of the value of the variable k becomes an important task. The general way of doing this is to train the model
on a set of different values of k and noting the performance of the trained model on the testing set. The model with the best value of accuracy_score is the one with the ideal value of the parameter k.

Check the performance of the model for 10 values of k, ranging from 1-9. You can evaluate the accuracy along with the standard deviation of the accuracy as well to
get a holistic picture of the model performance.

"""
Can you justify why the model performance on training data is deteriorating with increase in the value of k?


When k is small (e.g., k=1), the model is highly sensitive to the individual points in the dataset. The prediction for each point is based on its closest neighbor, which can lead to highly
specific and flexible boundaries. This leads to overfitting on the training data, meaning the model will perform very well on the training set, potentially achieving 100% accuracy. However,
it may generalize poorly to unseen data. When k is large, the model starts to take into account more neighbors when making predictions. This has two main consequences:

Smoothing of the Decision Boundary: The decision boundary becomes smoother, which means the model is less sensitive to the noise or fluctuations in the training data.
Less Specific Predictions: With a larger k, the model considers more neighbors and therefore makes more generalized predictions, which can lead to fewer instances being classified perfectly.
As a result, the model starts to become less flexible, and its ability to memorize the training data (which can lead to perfect accuracy with small k) is reduced.
"""

"""
We can see that even the with the optimum values, the KNN model is not performing that well on the given data set. Can you think of the possible reasons for this?

Enter you answer here

Click here for the solution
The weak performance on the model can be due to multiple reasons. 1. The KNN model relies entirely on the raw feature space at inference time.
If the features do no provide clear boundaries between classes, KNN model cannot compensate through optimization or feature transformation.
2. For a high number of weakly correlated features,
the number of dimensions increases, the distance between points tend to become more uniform, reducing the discriminative power of KNN.
3. The algorithm treats all features equally when computing distances. Hence, weakly correalted features can introduce noise or irrelevant variations 
in the feature space making it harder for KNN to find meaningful neighbours.
